>Problem:
    Given a list of integers, find and print the duplicates

Assume list is called list.
Store duplicates in a list called 'duplicate.'

1. Find and print the duplicates
    A. Identify duplicates
        i. sort first
            list.sort()
        ii. for each item, see if it matches the next
            a. for item in list:
                    if (item == next item):
                    add item to list of duplicates

            b. for idx in range(len(list) - 1):
                    if (list[idx] == list[idx + 1]):
                    duplicate.append(list[idx])

    B. Print the duplicates
        i. print(duplicate)

    -Problem Solving:
        Start with problem statement:
        Normally writen in english, sometimes ambiguous or incomplete.
        -Where is "file" located? How big is it or how do I know when I've reached the end?
        -How should final count be printed?
        .
        .
        .

>Conditional
    >If condition is true, do Subtask 1;
    else, do Subtask 2.

>Iterative
    Do Subtask over and over, as long as the test condition is true.

>Problem Solving Skills
    Learn to convert the problem statement into step by step description of subtasks

    >Like a puzzle, or a 'word problem' from grammar school math.
        >What is the starting state of the system?
        >What is the desired ending state?
        >How do we move from one state to another?
    >Recognize English words that correlate to three basic constructs:
        >'do A THEN do b' -sequential
        >'IF G, then do H' -conditional
        >'FOR EACH X, do Y -iterative
        >do Z UNTIL W -iterative
